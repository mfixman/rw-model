* Make all of the values modular ✓
    * Accumulate for randomness. ✓
        * Average V, A, alpha, etc. ✓
    * Plot alpha_mack and alpha_hall separately. ✓

* Fix Esther's Mackintosh.
    * Photo sent with new formula.
* Fix the outcome lambda.
    * When we update \alpha in the code, instead of using \lambda we should use the global error.
        * Global error = \lambda - \Sigma.
* 3D matrix Mackintosh training thing.
